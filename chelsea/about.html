         <h1>About Us</h1>
           <p>Chelsea Football Club was founded on March 10, 1905 by Henry Augustus Mears.</p>
           <p>The club was established at The Rising Sun pub, which is now The Butcher's Hook, on Fulham Road</p>
           <p>The training ground is located near Cobham in Surrey but sessions are not open to the general public.</p> 
           <p>Instead special open days are occasionally organised at Stamford Bridge where fans can see the team train. </p>
           <p>Chelsea FC is committed to tackling discrimination at Stamford Bridge and in our communities. We take an active</p> 
           <p>role in all the major anti-discrimination campaigns such as Kick It Out, Show Racism the Red Card and all UEFA backed</p>
           <p>Europe-wide campaigns including FARE. We have our own No to Hate and Say No to Antisemitism campaigns.</p>
